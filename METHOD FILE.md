# Sweet & Spicy BBQ Bean Burgers

## with BBQ Caramelized Onion, Pepper Jack, Dill Pickle & Potato Wedges Instructions

1  
• Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce. • Cut potatoes into ½-inch-thick wedges. Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion; mince a few slices until you have 2 TBSP (4 TBSP for 4 servings). Drain and rinse beans. Reserve ½ tsp BBQ seasoning (1 tsp for 4\) in a small bowl. Halve buns.

2  
• Toss potatoes on a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. • Roast on top rack until golden brown and crispy, 20-25 minutes.

3  
• Place half the beans (all for 4 servings) in a large bowl. Mash with a potato masher or fork until mostly smooth (it’s OK if there are still some larger pieces). • Stir in minced onion, ¾ of the tempura batter mix (all for 4), half the pepper jack, remaining BBQ seasoning, and 3 TBSP water (4 TBSP for 4\) until thoroughly combined. Season with salt (we used ¼ tsp; ½ tsp for 4\) and pepper. • Divide bean mixture into two mounds (four mounds for 4). Set aside.

4  
• Heat a drizzle of oil in a large, preferably nonstick, pan over medium-high heat. Add sliced onion and season with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly browned, 8-10 minutes. TIP: Lower heat and add a splash of water if onion begins to brown too quickly. • Stir in half the BBQ sauce; cook until warmed through, 2-3 minutes. • Remove pan from heat; transfer onion to a second small bowl. Carefully wash out pan.

5  
• While onion cooks, to bowl with reserved BBQ seasoning, stir in mayonnaise, 1 tsp pickle brine (2 tsp for 4 servings), and ¼ tsp sugar (½ tsp for 4). Season with salt and pepper.

6  
• Heat a drizzle of oil in pan used for onion over medium-high heat. Using a rubber spatula, add bean mixture mounds to pan and gently press to flatten into patties, each about as wide as a burger bun. Cook until bottoms are golden brown and crisp, 2-4 minutes. • Flip patties and carefully top with remaining pepper jack. Cover with a lid and cook until bottoms are crisp and cheese melts, 2-4 minutes more. Transfer to a plate. TIP: Depending on the size of your pan, you may need to work in batches, adding another drizzle of oil between batches.

7  
• While patties cook, toast buns until golden; spread cut sides of top buns with remaining BBQ sauce. Spread cut sides of bottom buns with half the BBQ mayo. • Fill buns with patties, onion, and as many pickles as you like. • Divide burgers between plates. Serve with potato wedges, any remaining pickles, and remaining BBQ mayo on the side for dipping.

## **ROASTED POTATO BRAVAS – SIDE**

**Prep Time**5 mins

**Cook Time**60 mins

**Total Time**65 mins

**Servings**4 servings

### Method

* Roast the potatoes:  
  Preheat oven to 375°F. Toss the potatoes with 3 tablespoons of olive oil and salt well. Arrange in one layer in a casserole pan or rimmed baking tray and roast until browned, about 50 minutes.  
* Sauté onions and garlic:  
  While the potatoes are roasting, make the sauce. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a medium pot set over medium-high heat. Sauté the chopped onions, stirring occasionally, for 4-5 minutes, or until they begin to brown on the edges. Add the garlic and sauté another 2 minutes.  
* Make the sauce:  
  Add the white wine to the pan and turn the heat to high. Boil on a high boil until the wine is reduced by half, then add the tomato paste and stir to combine. Add the crushed tomatoes, Tabasco sauce, salt, sugar and smoked paprika. Stir well and reduce the heat to a bare simmer. Let the sauce cook slowly while the potatoes roast. If you want, you can use a blender or an immersion blender to purée the sauce until smooth.  
* Toss potatoes with sauce, continue to roast:  
  When the potatoes are well browned, toss with the tomato sauce and return to the casserole pan. Continue to roast until the tomato sauce dries out a bit on the potatoes and caramelizes, about 10 minutes.  
  Serve with the remaining tomato sauce as an appetizer or side dish.

NOTES:  
Called papas bravas or [patatas bravas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patatas_bravas) in Spain, this dish is essentially potatoes cooked in a spicy sauce and served as an appetizer, or tapas.

Variations abound in both the [cooking method](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/easy-patatas-brava-recipe-8770761)—the potatoes are fried, boiled or roasted—and the sauce, which usually has hot chiles, tomato and vinegar.

The name of the recipe roughly [translates](http://www.spanishdict.com/translate/brava) into "fierce" or "angry" potatoes. But these potatoes are as spicy or "fierce" as you make them. We've made ours with some tomato sauce, quite a bit of Tabasco, and some smoked paprika

## **SMOKY JACKFRUIT FAJITAS WITH CHIPOTLE & FRESH HERBS**

### **Instructions**

1. Heat the oil in the skillet. Add the onion and half a teaspoon of sea salt. Cook until the onions are slighyly softened, about 10 minutes. Stir them often to avoid burning.  
2. Add the garlic and stir into the onions, then add the spices and herbs. You'll need 2 teaspoons of ground cumin, 1 teaspoon of ground coriander, 1 teaspoon of paprika, 1 and a half teaspoons of dried oregano and 1 teaspoon of dried coriander (cilantro).  
3. Stir the spices well into the onion and cook for a minute until the spices release their aromas, just a minute or two will do, be careful not to burn them\!  
4. Now add the drained jackfruit and the chipotle paste and stir well. Making sure the jackfruit is covered in paste and spices. Use a wooden spoon to break up the chunks of jackfruit.  
5. Season with the remaining sea salt and black pepper.  
6. Add the peppers to the pan along with the lime juice and maple syrup. Stir well and cook the peppers until they are slightly softened. If you prefer your peppers softer add them when you add the garlic.  
7. Finally, stir in the coriander and serve.  
8. I usually bring the skillet to the table, but be careful it will be very hot\!  
9. Serve with warm tortillas, fresh coriander, lime wedges, avocado or guacamole and salsa if you wish.

### **Notes**

* **Jackfruit** \- Make sure the jackfruit you buy is young jackfruit canned in water, this is very important\! Young jackfruit has a neutral taste. Jackfruit canned in syrup is very sweet and not suitable for this recipe.  
* **Don't overcook jackfruit \-** it can turn a bit mushy when overcooked and you don't want that, so be careful not to cook it for more than it needs.  
* **Heat** \- These fajitas are spicy\! If you plan on serving these to young children or people who don't tolerate spicy food very well then I would reduce the chipotle to just a teaspoon or half a teaspoon or omit it altogether, the fajitas will still taste great\!  
* **Maple Syrup \-** I add maple syrup to balance the flavours of these fajitas, you can use brown sugar if you prefer or omit it altogether.  
* **Storing/Making Ahead/ Freezing \-** These fajitas are best made fresh and are not suitable for freezing. Any leftovers can be stored in the fridge and should be used within a day or two. Reheat the jackfruit and pepper mixture on the hob until piping hot before serving.  
* **Nutritional Information** \- is calculated using an online nutrition tool and is approximate. It is based on two fajitas per person and does not include any toppings.

## **BUTTERNUT SQUASH & SAGE RISOTTO CAKES**

### **Instructions**

###  

#### **Risotto**

1. Saute the garlic and onion in a large skillet until onions are translucent.  
2. Add the butternut squash cubes and season with salt and pepper.  
3. Stir occasionally until the squash is tender but not cooked all the way through (about 5 minutes).  
4. Add the Arborio rice and sage. Stir to combine, then add wine and cook 1 minute longer.  
5. Add 2 cups of broth and bring to a simmer.  
6. Stir slightly; do not over-stir. Cook until the liquid evaporates(about 5 minutes).  
7. Then, add 1 cup of vegetable broth at a time and cook the same way until the rice is cooked and the fluid is absorbed.  
8. Continue to add the vegetable broth, 1 cup at a time, until all the vegetable broth is gone.  
9. Again, cook the mixture down until the liquid is absorbed. Do not over-stir the mixture. This process should take 10-15 minutes.  
10. Turn off the heat and stir in the nutritional yeast, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Stir in parsley.  
11. Now, eat the risotto as is, or go to teh next step to make the risotto cakes.

#### **Risotto Cakes**

1. To make the risotto cakes, spread the rice mixture in a thin layer on a baking sheet, prepared with a [silicone baking mat](https://amzn.to/3y98snk) or parchment paper.  
2. Cover with plastic wrap or another cover of your choice.  
3. Allow cooling completely, then transfer to the refrigerator.  
4. For the best results, refrigerate the risotto on the pan overnight or for at least 2 hours.  
5. Remove the chilled risotto from the refrigerator.  
6. Form small risotto cakes using a [small burger press](https://amzn.to/3C3P9wV), or you can prepare risotto balls.  
7. Another option is to make large risotto cakes using the larger-sized mold to form 6\.  
8. Or, use your hands to form 12 equal-sized cakes.

#### **Air Frying**

1. Preheat the air fryer to 350 degrees.  
2. Place the risotto cakes in a single layer on the air fry pan.  
3. If batch cooking, prepare a baking sheet with parchment paper and preheat an oven to 325 degrees to keep the risotto cakes warm while cooking the remaining risotto cakes.  
4. Cook for 8 minutes until crispy.  
5. If making larger cakes, increase the time to 15 minutes.

#### **Baking**

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  
2. Prepare a baking sheet with parchment paper.  
3. Cook for 20 minutes.  
4. If cooking larger cakes, cook for 35 minutes.

#### **Curry Sauce**

1. In a medium saucepan, combine grated ginger and shallots and saute until the shallots are translucent.  
2. Add the lime juice and zest from one lime and a pinch of salt.  
3. Add the lime juice and zest from one lime and a pinch of salt.  
4. Stir, and then add coconut milk and red chili paste.  
5. The sauce thickens as it heats.

### **Notes**

* Use short-grain rice. Short-grain rice "is built for" risotto.  
* Know the texture you prefer. You don't want the rice gummy.  
* Avoid overcooking.  
* Don't rinse your rice\! Risotto cooks better when the rice is not rinsed.  
* Keep an eye on the temperature, and do not over-stir or overwork the rice.  
* Stirring the rice constantly will add air to the risotto, cooling it down and making it gluey. But the rice will stick to the bottom and burn if you don't stir enough. Agitating the rice is essential because risotto's creaminess comes from the starch generated when grains of rice rub against each other.

## **THAI BASIL TOFU AND BABY BOK CHOY SAUTÉ**

### Instructions

###  

1. Pat dry the block of tofu and slice in cubes of about 1-2 inches. Then, transfer to a large bowl and add a little salt. Then, sprinkle about half of the cornstarch over and use your hands to toss the cubes around. Add the other half of cornstarch and keep stirring until all cubes are well covered.  
2. Also clean and slice the bok choy (see blog post and video for tips). You will need to divide the white and green parts of the vegetable.  
3. Warm up a small amount of sesame oil in a large non-stick pan (or a wok) on medium-high heat.  
4. Add the tofu and cook for a few minutes on each side. You want each side to be roasted and golden brown, so flip them once in a while. This can take 10-15 minutes. Once done, transfer on a plate and set aside.  
5. While the tofu is roasting, whisk all the stir-fry sauce ingredients together in a medium bowl (soy sauce, rice vinegar, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, water, cornstarch and sesame oil). Set aside.  
6. Quickly wipe the pan and transfer back on the stove. Add a little more sesame oil and then add the onion. Cook for about 2 minutes on medium-high heat stirring often and then add the white parts from the bok choy. Stir often and cook until softened, but still crunchy, for about 3-4 minutes.  
7. Then, add the green parts of the bok choy to the pan and stir to help the leaves slightly wilt. Pour the sauce over, stir right away and keep cooking for about 2 minutes or until the sauce is thicker and the leaves nicely soft. Then, add the tofu back to the pan and stir well to warm up everything together.  
8. Serve warm with brown rice, quinoa or farro and sesame seeds. Can also be served over Asian style noodles such as soba, udon or vermicelli rice noodles.

### Notes

* Keep leftovers in the fridge for up to 3 days in an air-tight container.  
* Serve garnished with sesame seeds, green onions or sriracha sauce.  
* You can also use about 5-6 baby bok choy. In that case, you won't need to separate the white and green parts of the vegetables. Other cruciferous veggies can be used in place of the bok choy such as broccoli, Napa cabbage, green cabbage, cauliflower or Chinese broccoli.

## **TOMATO RED LENTIL SOUP WITH HERBS**

### **Instructions**

1. Heat the olive oil *(2 tablespoons)* in a large heavy pot with a lid, such as a Dutch oven, over medium-high heat. Sauté the onions until softened and starting to brown, about 5 minutes.  
2. Add the minced garlic *(2 cloves)*, cumin *(1 teaspoon),* and chili powder *(½ teaspoon)*. Stir to coat the onions in the spices and continue heating for 30 seconds to one minute, until fragrant.  
3. Add the rinsed red lentils *(8 oz.).* Stir to coat. Pour in the chicken broth *(6 cups)* and add the diced sweet potato, the diced carrots, and the canned diced tomatoes *(15 oz.)*. Bring to a boil, turn the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes, or until lentils, sweet potatoes, and carrots are tender.  
4. Turn off the heat. Stir in the lemon juice *(about 2 tablespoons)* and fresh chopped herbs *(¼ cup)*. Serve, with optional extra olive oil, herbs, Greek yogurt, red pepper flakes, and/or lemon wedges.

### **Notes**

* **Broth:** I almost always prefer to use homemade broth *([chicken](https://www.bowlofdelicious.com/chicken-stock/) or [vegetable](https://www.bowlofdelicious.com/scrap-vegetable-stockbroth/))* for soups, which is what I used here. You can also use a bouillon substitute, like [Better than Bouillon](https://amzn.to/3k7INaO). Be careful, as store-bought broth and bouillon tend to be salty, so you may need very little, if any, additional salt for the soup, or buy a low-sodium version. Be sure to use vegetable broth to ensure the soup is vegetarian/vegan, if that’s your goal.  
* **Red lentils** usually come in a 16 oz. *(1 pound)* bag. This recipe uses half that amount, 8 oz., which comes out to a little more than 1 cup. You can use more or less than that depending on what you have, but keep in mind you may need more or less broth accordingly.  
* **Fresh herbs:** I use a combo of dill, mint, parsley, and oregano, because it’s what I had. You can truly use what you want here, what you have growing, or what’s on sale at the store. Just stay away from tougher and stronger herbs, like rosemary, thyme, and sage, as their flavors and textures may overpower in this recipe.  
* **Don’t skip** the fresh lemon juice here – that added acidity adds a ton of flavor *(though you may be able to get by with a tablespoon of red wine or apple cider vinegar in a pinch)*.  
* **Adding a swirl of extra-virgin olive oil** at the end when serving is highly recommended. It adds satiating healthy fat, amazing flavor, and a beautiful rich texture. I also recommend a dash of red pepper flakes if you enjoy spice, which takes the flavor of the soup to the next level without overpowering.  
* **Freeze the leftovers** in an airtight container for up to 6 months.

## **CURRY CAULIFLOWER & POTATO SOUP**

## **Directions**

STEP 1

* Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.

STEP 2 

Combine coriander, cumin, cinnamon, turmeric, salt, pepper and cayenne in a small bowl. Toss cauliflower with 1 tablespoon oil in a large bowl, sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of the spice mixture and toss again. Spread in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Roast the cauliflower until the edges are browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside.

STEP 3:  
Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion and carrot and cook, stirring often, until starting to brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and continue cooking, stirring often, until the onion is soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Add garlic, ginger, chile and the remaining spice mixture. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute more.

STEP 4:  
Stir in tomato sauce, scraping up any browned bits, and simmer for 1 minute. Add broth, potatoes, sweet potatoes, lime zest and juice. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook, partially covered and stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender, 35 to 40 minutes.

STEP 5:  
Stir in coconut milk and the roasted cauliflower. Return to a simmer to heat through. Serve garnished with cilantro and chiles, if desired.

## **GINGER PEACH MUFFINS WITH OAT STREUSEL**

### Instructions

###  

1. Pre-heat the oven to 375º. Line a muffin pan with 8 paper liners.  
2. In a small bowl, combine the flax seed with the water, stir and set aside until ready to use.  
3. In a large bowl, combine the flour, rolled oats and baking powder. Set aside.  
4. In a medium bowl, add the coconut oil and melt in the microwave for about 1 minute or so (or until completely melted). Then, add the flax seed mixture, maple syrup, vanilla extract and vegan milk. Stir to combine.  
5. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ones and stir until just combined (avoid overmixing). Then, fold in gently the diced peaches.  
6. Divide the batter in between the prepared 8 muffin tins and bake for 18-20 minutes or until a tooth pick comes out clean.

### Notes

* How to store: Let the muffins completely cool down, then transfer to an air-tight container and store for up to 5 days in the fridge. I like to slightly warm them up before eating after resting in the fridge for a while. These muffins can also be frozen.  
* How to make them oil-free: I did try them out swapping the coconut oil for apple sauce (same amount). Although the texture was a little better with the oil, they were still very good\!  
* How to make them gluten-free: you can try using a 1:1 gluten-free baking flour instead of the wheat flour.   
* How to make them nut-free: make sure to use a nut-free vegan milk, like oat milk.

## **PLUM & APPLE CRUMBLE WITH CINNAMON-ALMOND CRUNCH**

### **Instructions**

1. Preheat the oven to 180˚C fan / 200 ˚C / 356˚F convection / 392˚F.

#### **Make the crumble topping**

1. Add the flour and almond flour / ground almonds to a large mixing bowl and rub the butter in with your finger tips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.  
2. Stir in the sugar and place the topping to one side whilst you prepare the fruit.

#### **Prepare the fruit**

1. Cut the plums in half and take the stone out, then cut each half in to 4-6 pieces depending on the size of the plum.  
2. Peel and core the apples, then cut each apple in to quarters. Cut each quarter in to 3\. So you have 12 pieces of apple per apple.  
3. Place the prepared plums and apples in a 25cm x 30cm (9" x 12") baking dish and mix with the sugar and mixed spice.  
4. Sprinkle over the topping to cover the fruit and place in the preheated oven.  
5. Bake for 35-40 minutes until the top is golden, and the fruit is tender.  
6. Serve straight away.

### **Notes**

Nutritional information calculated on the crumble serving 6 people.  
Apples – approx 4 small apples. I use whatever apple is in the fridge to make a crumble: Jazz apples, Pink lady apples, Granny Smiths. You can use bramley apples too. Bramleys become softer when cooking so you don’t need to cut them into as small chunks as the other varieties of apple.  
Plums – approx 6 plums. Most varieties of plum will make a delicious crumble, however you really want to have juice, ripe plums. If you use underripe plums you will need to add a little more sugar. Blood plums (aka satsuma plum) with their red flesh, or other red fleshed varieties add a lovely colour to the crumble.  
Butter – unsalted butter.  
Soft brown sugar – soft brown sugar is mixed with the apples and plums to give a lovely caramel flavour. If your apples and plums are very underripe I recommend adding another 1-1.5 tablespoons of brown sugar to them otherwise the crumble may be a little sour.  
Raw sugar – In Australia I like to make the crumble topping with raw sugar, as it adds a honey type taste to the crumble topping. You can use ⅓ brown sugar and ⅔ white sugar, or if you are in the UK, demerara sugar is a great alternative.  
Spices – mixed spice adds a warming note to the crumble, if you can’t get mixed spice then cinnamon is a great alternative.  
Don’t pile the fruit in too thick a layer as it will take longer to cook.  
Cut the apples the same size, and the plums slightly larger than the apple, to ensure the fruit is all cooked evenly and all soft.  
Never press down the crumble topping on top of the fruit\! Otherwise your crumble will be hard and stodgy rather than crispy and light.
