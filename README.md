🌿 What is this?

A simple, beautiful way to turn our SHOP sheet into interactive recipe cards:

📖 Clear & precise instructions

🖼️ Recipe images for easy reference

🎚️ Built-in slider to adjust quantities on the fly

📂 Just upload the SHOP sheet → get instant recipe cards

🍫 Example

Brownies + Cheesecake, scaled perfectly with the slider:

🍫 Brownies  
- 0.25 flax egg
- 0.04 cup peanut butter  
- 0.10 cup sugar  
...

🍰 Cheesecake  
- 0.67 oz cream cheese  
- 0.19 cup sugar  
...

🛠️ How it Works

📤 Upload the SHOP sheet

🔄 Data parses into categories (currently hardcoded, but flexible)

🖥️ Recipe cards are rendered inside a Bootstrap modal

🎚️ Slide the scale → ingredient amounts update automatically

🚀 Future Ideas

📸 Add more images for each recipe

🧾 Auto-detect categories instead of hardcoding

👩‍🍳 Add “cook mode” (step-by-step view)

🎨 More fun styling & animations

❤️ Vibes Matter Most

This project is about making things fun and useful for cooks in the kitchen — not just devs behind the screen. Keep it light, keep it tasty, keep it amore. 🌙🍕✨
