‚ú® For the cooks. By the cooks. ‚ú®

What is this?

A simple way to turn our SHOP sheet into interactive recipe cards:

 Clear, precise instructions

 Recipe images for easy reference

 Built-in slider to adjust quantities on the fly

 Just upload the SHOP sheet ‚Üí get instant recipe cards

The Point:

Cooks usually work from scraps of paper, memory, or scattered notes. Meanwhile, chefs and managers make decisions from a single, structured source of truth (the SHOP sheet).

This project brings those worlds together.

By turning the SHOP sheet into interactive recipe cards, cooks get direct access to the same information the chef and partners use to run the business. No translation, no lag, no ‚Äúwe‚Äôll print the new recipes next week.‚Äù Just clarity, immediacy, and alignment across the team.

Future & Insights:

Knowledge is power in the kitchen, too. With the same data powering recipes, we can unlock potential.

Itegrate the PLAN sheet as well so each item will also display current STATUS, CHEF, etc

The vision: recipe cards that don‚Äôt just instruct, but connect cooks to the bigger picture AND TO EACH OTHER...

How it Works:

Upload the SHOP sheet as a CSV. You can DL the CSV from the google sheet. We can use any format but CSV was easier for me to look at. But we can easily add support for PDF or whatever format google sheets on mobile makes you download. Or we can populate it for the user so they simply download it with everything done.

Data parsing: Ingredients are pulled into categories (currently hardcoded, but flexible).

Recipe modal rendering:

Ingredient lists populate dynamically.

Step-by-step cooking instructions are loaded from methods.js.

Each recipe entry in methods.js includes its instruction steps.

When you open a recipe modal, the correct method is matched and rendered in order.

Scaling: Slide the scale ‚Üí ingredient amounts update instantly.

Future Ideas

 More images for each recipe

 Auto-detect categories instead of hardcoding

 Add cook-to-cook interactions

 More styling & animations for better kitchen usability
