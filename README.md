🍴 Recipe Cards for The Tasteful Kitchen

✨ For the cooks. By the cooks. ✨

What is this?

A simple way to turn our SHOP sheet into interactive recipe cards:

 Clear, precise instructions

 Recipe images for easy reference

 Built-in slider to adjust quantities on the fly

 Just upload the SHOP sheet → get instant recipe cards

How it Works

Upload the SHOP sheet

Data parsing: Ingredients are pulled into categories (currently hardcoded, but flexible).

Recipe modal rendering:

Ingredient lists populate dynamically.

Step-by-step cooking instructions are loaded from methods.js.

Each recipe entry in methods.js includes its instruction steps.

When you open a recipe modal, the correct method is matched and rendered in order.

Scaling: Slide the scale → ingredient amounts update instantly.

Future Ideas

 More images for each recipe

 Auto-detect categories instead of hardcoding

 Add true “cook mode” (step-by-step guided view)

 More styling & animations for better kitchen usability

❤️ Vibes Matter Most

This project is about making things fun and useful for cooks in the kitchen — not just devs behind the screen. Keep it light, keep it tasty, keep it…

When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, it’s… AMORE. 🌙🍕✨
