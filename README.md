✨ For the cooks. By the cooks. ✨

What is this?

A simple way to turn our SHOP sheet into interactive recipe cards:

 Clear, precise instructions

 Recipe images for easy reference

 Built-in slider to adjust quantities on the fly

 Just upload the SHOP sheet → get instant recipe cards

The Point

Cooks usually work from scraps of paper, memory, or scattered notes. Meanwhile, chefs and managers make decisions from a single, structured source of truth (the SHOP sheet).

This project brings those worlds together.

By turning the SHOP sheet into interactive recipe cards, cooks get direct access to the same information the chef and partners use to run the business. No translation, no lag, no “we’ll print the new recipes next week.” Just clarity, immediacy, and alignment across the team.

Future Metrics & Insights

Knowledge is power in the kitchen, too. With the same data powering recipes, we can unlock more:

Sales history: Show how much of a dish we’ve sold before.

Ingredient insights: Fun facts, sourcing notes, or health details for each ingredient.

Usage metrics: Compare ingredient use against averages, highlight cost drivers, or flag shortages in real-time.

Visualizations: Integrate D3 or other tools to make trends easy to understand at a glance.

Engagement: Turn data into a living, interactive part of the cook’s workflow — not just something buried in back-office spreadsheets.

The vision: recipe cards that don’t just instruct, but connect cooks to the bigger picture.

How it Works

Upload the SHOP sheet

Data parsing: Ingredients are pulled into categories (currently hardcoded, but flexible).

Recipe modal rendering:

Ingredient lists populate dynamically.

Step-by-step cooking instructions are loaded from methods.js.

Each recipe entry in methods.js includes its instruction steps.

When you open a recipe modal, the correct method is matched and rendered in order.

Scaling: Slide the scale → ingredient amounts update instantly.

Future Ideas

 More images for each recipe

 Auto-detect categories instead of hardcoding

 Add true “cook mode” (step-by-step guided view)

 More styling & animations for better kitchen usability
